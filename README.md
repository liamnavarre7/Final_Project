The project is a study and exploration of Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 activity data. The data was compared between two students at two seperate colleges. One being Gonzaga University and the other being Santa Clara. The study is used to show how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected our general activity. This is why Fall 2020 was used because it was around the peak of the pandemic. I then chose Fall 2021 for the fact that the peak of the pandemic is over and society is slowly heading towards a post Covid-19 way of living. 

The Data used was from the input files LiamHealthData.csv and AnaHealthData.csv

The Utils file is where the utility code within the program was used. 

Main.ipynb is where the project itself is stored and python 3.8 and above is required to run the program.

Liam_Cleaned_health_data.csv and Ana_cleaned_health_data.csv is where the cleaned input files are put and stored.
